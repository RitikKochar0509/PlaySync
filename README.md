## Introduction

PlaySync is a web application built with React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, designed to provide a cutting-edge video streaming experience. It combines several powerful features to offer users a seamless and engaging experience. This README will guide you through the setup, features, and usage of the application.

## Features

### Optimized Search
PlaySync implements a highly optimized search functionality. It utilizes debouncing to prevent unnecessary API requests while users type in their search queries. Additionally, API polling ensures that search results stay up-to-date, providing users with real-time content suggestions.

### Live Chat Streaming
Engage with other users in real-time through our integrated live chat feature. Discuss your favorite videos, share insights, and connect with the PlaySync community while watching videos.

### N-Level Comments
Similar to popular video-sharing platforms like YouTube, PlaySync supports n-level comments. This means users can reply to comments, creating dynamic and interactive discussions around video content.

### Caching for API Calls
To improve performance and reduce server load, PlaySync implements caching for API calls. Frequent API requests for the same data are stored locally, reducing latency and enhancing the overall user experience.

### Video Player
Enjoy high-quality video playback with PlaySync's video player. Seamlessly stream videos with features like playback controls, full-screen mode, and video quality settings, making your viewing experience similar to YouTube.
